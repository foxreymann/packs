# Task

Using the provided JSON structure, produce the HTML and CSS markup to present each of the packs with a thumbnail preview on the left and a pack name and details to the right, as demonstrated in the attached wireframe http://i.imgur.com/k2OkQGF.jpg. Offer a way to sort the packs without a page refresh using JS (jQuery or other known frameworks allowed). You are encouraged to exercise your knowledge of the latest frontend markup.
